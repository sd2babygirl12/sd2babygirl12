Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

In the project that I am showing the code that is going to allow Chada Tech clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.What did you do particularly well?

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The part of the code that I found to be most difficult when writing the code to make what the company wanted was the actual writing the code itself. I had a lot of help from tutors. They were a big help to overcome the obstacles that I had faced while writing the code.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think that every coding language is special in its own way and that once you learn it then you can transfer it to the real job. The language is easier to read when you know the language and what it would print out in the end.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
